## Hi there ğŸ‘‹  I'm Mathew Lee, aka Math.Rand().

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently interesting in high-performance low latency Python coding techniques, with a focus on asynchronous programming, efficient data structures, and just-in-time compilation techniques.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning / deep learning.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any of the above.
